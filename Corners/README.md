## Credits

- This sddm theme is from [hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots/). I extracted the theme from that repository and put it upstream in Github. Thank you https://github.com/prasanthrangan/ for this great work. 

- Likely this theme is based on https://github.com/aczw/sddm-theme-corners. I don't know really. I search for corners and it pops up in the first page of results. Thank you https://github.com/aczw/.
